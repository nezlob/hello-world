# hello-world
to learn github, git and maybe more
yeah so hello world, I am Kevin, 66 summers and 67 coming. I know nothing of code other rthan vagueish. 
I come here to brighten my life, you might think desparate, and you might be right, I am often sad.
These changes are following guidance from hubot and your guide.
